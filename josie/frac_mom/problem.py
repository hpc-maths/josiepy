class FracMomProblem(ConvectiveProblem):
    """A class representing an PGD system problem

    Attributes
    ---------
    eos
        An instance of :class:`~.EOS`, an equation of state for the fluid
    """

    def F(self, cells: CellSet) -> np.ndarray:
        r""" This returns the tensor representing the flux for an PGD model

        A general problem can be written in a compact way:

        .. math::

            \pdv{\vb{q}}{t} + \div{\vb{F\qty(\vb{q})}} + \vb{B}\qty(\vb{q})
            \cdot \gradient{\vb{q}} = \vb{s\qty(\vb{q})}

        This function needs to return :math:`\vb{F}\qty(\vb{q})`

        Parameters
        ----------
        cells
            A :class:`MeshCellSet` that contains the cell data

        Returns
        ---------
        F
            An array of dimension :math:`Nx \times Ny \times 4 \times 2`, i.e.
            an array that of each :math:`x` cell and :math:`y` cell stores the
            :math:`4 \times 2` flux tensor

            The flux tensor is:
