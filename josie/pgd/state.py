r"""
We create one big state that contains the actual conservative variables that
are used in the flux together with the "auxiliary" variables that are instead
needed, for example, to compute the speed of sound.

.. math::

    \eulerState


* ``rho``: density :math:`\rho`
* | ``rhoU``: component along :math:`x` of the velocity :math:`\vb{u}`,
  | multiplied by the density
* | ``rhoV``: component along :math:`y` of the velocity :math:`\vb{u}`,
  | multiplied by the density
* ``rhoE``: total energy multiplied by the density :math:`\rho E`
* ``rhoe``: internal energy multiplied by the density :math:`\rho e`
* ``U``: component along :math:`x` of the velocity :math:`u`
* ``V``: component along :math:`y` of the velocity :math:`v`
* ``p``: pressure :math:`p`
* ``c``: sound velocity :math:`c`
